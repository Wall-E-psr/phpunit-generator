# PhpUnitGenerator: Documentation

This documentation contains console command and annotations usage.

## Before using this package

__DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE WITHOUT CHECKING GENERATED TESTS!__

All generated unit tests must be checked completely before implementing them.

Php files have multiple patterns (having namespaces, interfaces, class, traits, php functions ...).

Since php version 7.1 is available, it is better to have parameters and return type hints for functions and methods.
PhpUnitGenerator will better generate your unit tests with them.
